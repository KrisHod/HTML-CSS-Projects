	<h3>About breed</h3>
		<p>The Greyhound is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing game and greyhound racing. It is also referred to as an English Greyhound. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.</p>
